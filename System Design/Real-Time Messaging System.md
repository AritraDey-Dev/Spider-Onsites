# Message Delivery Platform

Imagine you are developing a messaging application to help people stay connected instantly, similar to popular apps like WhatsApp or Messenger. Your friend, Alex, is an avid user of your app and frequently sends messages to his friends and family. However, he notices that every time he sends a message, it takes a while to reach the recipient, causing frustrating delays in their conversations.

One day, Alex sends an urgent message to his friend, Sam, about a change in their meeting location. Unfortunately, Sam receives the message much later, leading to confusion and a missed opportunity. Alex reaches out to you, explaining the issue and expressing the need for truly real-time communication.

Determined to solve this problem, you decide to redesign the messaging system to ensure low latency and fast message delivery. Your goal is to create a system where messages are delivered almost instantaneously, providing a seamless and satisfying user experience.
