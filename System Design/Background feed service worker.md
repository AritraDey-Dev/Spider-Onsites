# Development of a Service Worker for Background Feed Generation

## Overview

The objective is to create a service worker that generates a feed of posts from first and second-degree connections and sends it to users in the background. This service will utilize device caching to enhance performance and ensure that users receive updates even when they are offline.

## Subtasks

### 1. Low-Level Design (LLD) Documentation

- **Define Service Worker Lifecycle**  
  Outline the lifecycle of the service worker, including installation, activation, and fetch events.

- **Data Structure**  
  Design the data structure for storing posts from first and second-degree connections. The structure should include fields such as:
  - Post ID
  - Content
  - Author
  - Timestamp
  - Connection degree

- **Caching Strategy**  
  Specify the caching strategy to be used for storing and retrieving posts. Consider strategies like Cache First or Network First.

- **Background Sync**  
  Plan the implementation of Background Sync to periodically fetch new posts and update the feed.

- **Notification System**  
  Design a notification system to alert users when new posts are available. Define the format and content of the notifications.

- **Error Handling**  
  Outline error handling strategies for network failures, cache misses, and other potential issues.

### 2. Implementation of Functionalities (Bonus Task)

- **Service Worker Registration**  
  Implement the registration of the service worker in the main application.

- **Fetch and Cache Logic**  
  Write the logic to fetch posts from the server and cache them using the defined caching strategy.

- **Background Sync Setup**  
  Implement the Background Sync API to periodically fetch new posts from the server.

- **Push Notifications**  
  Integrate push notifications to inform users about new posts, ensuring they can view updates even when the app is not open.

- **User Interface Updates**  
  Create a user interface to display the feed of posts, allowing users to interact with the content.
