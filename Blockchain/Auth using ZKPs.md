# User Authentication System Using Zero-Knowledge Proofs

## Overview
In this implementation, we will use zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable users to prove their identity without revealing their password to the server. Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic methods that allow one party to prove to another party that they know a value without revealing the value itself.

## Components
1. **User:** The person attempting to authenticate.
2. **Server:** The system verifying the user's identity.
3. **ZKP Protocol:** The cryptographic method used to prove knowledge of the password without revealing it.

## Steps for Implementation

### 1. Setup Phase
- **Password Hashing:**
  - When a user registers, their password should be hashed using a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256). The hashed password is stored in the server's database.

- **ZKP Setup:**
  - Initialize the ZKP system. This includes choosing the appropriate cryptographic protocol (e.g., Schnorr protocol, zk-SNARKs).

### 2. Authentication Phase
- **Challenge Generation:**
  - The server generates a random challenge (nonce) and sends it to the user.

- **Proof Generation:**
  - The user creates a proof using the ZKP protocol. This proof demonstrates that they know the password (or its hash) without revealing it. For example, using the Schnorr protocol, the user will create a commitment to their password hash and then generate a response to the server's challenge.

- **Proof Verification:**
  - The server verifies the proof. If the proof is valid, the user is authenticated; otherwise, access is denied.
