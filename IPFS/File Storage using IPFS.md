# Exploring IPFS for Decentralized File Storage

## Objective
The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) by setting up a local node, uploading multiple files, and creating a simple decentralized application (dApp) that utilizes IPFS for file storage.

## Guidelines

### 1. Set Up Your IPFS Node
- **Install the IPFS CLI** and initialize a local IPFS node.
- **Ensure that your node is running** and connected to the IPFS network.

### 2. Upload Multiple Files
- **Choose a set of files** (e.g., images, documents) and upload them to your IPFS node.
- **Generate and document** the Content Identifiers (CIDs) for each file.

### 3. Implement File Retrieval
- **Create a simple script or application** that retrieves and displays the uploaded files using their CIDs.
- **This could be a command-line tool** or a basic web application that fetches and displays the files from IPFS.

### 4. Explore IPFS Features
- **Investigate IPFS features** such as file versioning, pinning, and the use of IPNS (InterPlanetary Naming System) for creating mutable links to your content.
- **Implement pinning for your uploaded files** to ensure they remain accessible.

### 5. Build a Simple Decentralized Application (dApp)
- **Develop a basic web application** that allows users to upload files to your IPFS node.
- **The application should display** the CID of each uploaded file and provide a link to access the file via a public IPFS gateway.

### 6. Deploy Your dApp (optional)
- **Host your web application** on a decentralized platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify) or a traditional web server.
- **Ensure that your application** can interact with the IPFS network effectively.

## Bonus Task: Experiment with IPFS Cluster
- **Set up an IPFS Cluster** to manage multiple IPFS nodes.
- **Explore how to achieve high availability** and redundancy for your files.
