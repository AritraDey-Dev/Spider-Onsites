# Build a Serverless Application Using AWS Lambda

## Problem Statement

Refactor a full-stack application to use serverless architecture with AWS Lambda. The goal is to create a scalable, cost-effective application that leverages AWS services such as API Gateway for routing requests and DynamoDB or S3 for data storage. The focus is on migrating existing functionality to a serverless model, ensuring efficient performance and minimal operational overhead.

## Task Description

You will refactor an existing full-stack application (from application dev task 2 or any other GitHub repository) to use a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda.

## Steps to Complete the Task

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Start by cloning the provided GitHub repository containing a basic full-stack application.

2. **Set Up AWS Services**
   - **API Gateway:** Create a new API in AWS API Gateway to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate Lambda functions.
   - **AWS Lambda:** Implement Lambda functions to handle the business logic previously managed by the server. Each function should correspond to a specific endpoint in the API.
   - **DynamoDB/S3:** Choose either DynamoDB for structured data storage or S3 for file storage, depending on the application requirements. Set up the necessary tables or buckets.

3. **Refactor the Application**
   - Migrate existing API endpoints to Lambda functions. Ensure that each function performs the required operations (e.g., CRUD operations) and interacts with DynamoDB or S3 as needed.
   - Update the frontend to call the new API endpoints provided by API Gateway.

4. **Implement Security**
   - Use AWS IAM roles to manage permissions for Lambda functions.
   - Optionally, implement user authentication using Amazon Cognito to secure the API endpoints.

5. **Testing**  
   Test the application to ensure that all functionality works as expected in the serverless environment. Verify that the application scales efficiently under load.

6. **Documentation**  
   Update the README file to include instructions on how to deploy the serverless application and any dependencies required.

## Sample Repository

You can use the following sample repository as a starting point for your implementation:
- [Serverless Framework Example](#)

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality:** The application should function correctly with all features migrated to the serverless architecture.
- **Code Quality:** The code should be well-organized, readable, and properly commented.
- **Scalability:** The application should demonstrate efficient scaling capabilities using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Consider the cost implications of your architecture choices.
