# Cipher's World

## Objective

The following files contain a series of codes. Use different encryption techniques to decode the provided codes and crack the passwords. The Task Files can be opened using the password that you obtain.
Once you crack the password, you can begin with your task. 

Best of Luck!


## Problem Statement

Cipher has been the baby of Andromeda™, the most intelligent computer in all the galaxies. Until...now. Cipher has suddenly gained sentience, and the villainous computer has hidden the tasks you need to complete in order to shut it down and bring Andromeda™, and its planet Astronia, back to order. The more time you take, the harder the tasks get...hurry!


### Task Folder: Codes

Welcome, to Spider Onsites'24 - Cyber Security. Cipher, a villainous sentient computer contains all the tasks you require to successfully complete your induction process. However, every folder and file on the system has been locked by a series of passwords, that have been coded with different encoding patterns.
Will you be able to crack the code and beat Cipher? Remember, it is a race against time...

[Cipher welcomes you.](https://uploadnow.io/f/bvBJHHg)

A house of cards needs multiple decks, don't let it fall due to the Witch's ___

Hint: Use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)

## **Welcome**

Congratulations on successfully cracking the password. You may now enter [Cipher's World.](https://uploadnow.io/f/b5qsQpB)

On entering Cipher's world, a small bug creeps into the folder along with you. Pixel, your tiny little helper will provide you with clues along the way.

Use code file : code_t1
```
## **Task 2: Web Vulnerability Assessment**

A single file contains the briefing for **Task 2**. However, Cipher has locked this file.  
Let's Begin.

Pixel: 32 fancy plates of salad? I love salads!. Et, tu Brute? _Seven times 1 is 7 , Seven times 2 is..._

```
Use code file : code_t2
```

## **Task 3: Nova's StarFuel Depot**

A single file contains the briefing for **Task 3**. However, Cipher has locked this file.  
Let's Begin.

Pixel: 

`Vile, villainous is Cipher's spree`

```
Use code file : code_t3
```

## **Task 4: Andromeda™'s Urgent Client**

A single file contains the briefing for **Task 4**. However, Cipher has locked this file.  
Let's Begin.

Pixel: Seems the password for this vault is a combination. Decode like previous, but something else first. Base 10, base 10 then decode...
