# Qiskit Command Line Interface

**Problem Statement:**

Create a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows users to interact with pre-defined quantum circuits generated from the Qiskit library. The tool should provide a choice of 2-3 different quantum circuits, such as Superdense Coding or Quantum Teleportation, or any of the circuits given in the qiskit tutorials in resource. 

There should be added functionality to allow users to input the qubits to be used. The tool should then display the selected quantum circuit, execute it, and show the intermediate qubit states at each step of the circuit.

**Note:**
To accomplish this task, you will need to use the following tools and resources:

1. **Qiskit**: The Qiskit library is a key component for this project, as it provides the necessary functions and classes to create, visualize, and execute quantum circuits.
2. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: You will need to create a CLI using a Python library like `argparse` or `click` to allow users to interact with the tool and select the desired quantum circuit, or any other alternatives.
3. **Qiskit Visualization**: Utilize the `qiskit.visualization` module to display the quantum circuits and the intermediate qubit states.
4. **Quantum circuit simulation**: Use simulation environment like 'qasm simulation' from 'Qiskit.Aer' for running the quantum circuits

**Note:**
For completion of this task, you can run it locally and no need to use actual quantum simulations like IBM etc. You can use virtual simulations like Qasm simulator.

**Resources:**

1. **Qiskit Documentation**: The official Qiskit documentation provides comprehensive information on how to use the library, including examples of creating and executing quantum circuits: [Qiskit Documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/)
2. **Qiskit Tutorials**: The Qiskit GitHub repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various quantum computing concepts and Qiskit usage: [Qiskit Tutorials](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials)


By completing this task, you will gain hands-on experience with Qiskit, learn how to create and execute quantum circuits, and develop a tool that can be used to educate and engage users with the concepts of quantum computing.
