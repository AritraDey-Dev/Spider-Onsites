# Full-Stack Development Enhancements

## Objective
This project aims to enhance an existing site (or previous tasks) by implementing various full-stack functionalities. The focus will be on improving performance, security, and user experience through the following key features.

## Key Functionalities to Implement

### 1. Progressive Web App (PWA) Features

### 2. Redis Integration
- **Functionality:** Integrate Redis to cache frequently accessed data and improve response times.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Use Redis for session management, allowing for faster user authentication.
  - Implement rate limiting to protect against abuse and enhance security.
  - Store real-time data to improve performance for dynamic content.

### 3. reCAPTCHA Integration
- **Functionality:** Implement reCAPTCHA to protect the application from spam and bot attacks.
