# Social Media API

## Objective
Develop a GraphQL API for managing users, posts, comments, and likes in a basic social media application.

## Description
This project involves designing and implementing a GraphQL schema that includes users, posts, comments, and likes. The API will allow for the following functionalities:
- Fetching users, posts, and comments through queries.
- Creating, updating, and deleting posts and comments through mutations.
- Using MongoDB as the database to store and retrieve data.

## Expectations
1. **GraphQL Schema:**
   - Define types for `User`, `Post`, `Comment`, and `Like`.
   
2. **Resolvers:**
   - Implement resolvers for queries and mutations to handle data fetching and manipulation.

3. **GraphQL Server:**
   - Set up a working GraphQL server using [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) and connect it to MongoDB.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Provide documentation on how to interact with the API, including sample queries and mutations.
