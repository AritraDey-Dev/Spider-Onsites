# Multithreaded Video Stitching and Transformation

## Problem Statement
The objective of this challenge is to develop a multithreaded application in Golang that stitches multiple video streams together, applies transformations to the stitched video using a machine learning API, and saves the processed video.

## Objective
Create a program that performs the following tasks:
1. Stitch multiple video files into a single video.
2. Apply transformations to the stitched video frames using a machine learning API.
3. Implement multithreading to optimize performance during video processing.
4. Save the final processed video to a specified output file.

## Task Description
You are provided with multiple video files: `video1.mp4`, `video2.mp4`, `video3.mp4`, and `video4.mp4`. Your task is to create a program that performs the following steps:

### 1. Video Stitching
- Stitch the four video files together into a single video, ensuring that the frames are synchronized and the aspect ratio is maintained.

### 2. Frame Transformation
- Apply a transformation (e.g., grayscale, edge detection, or a custom filter) to each frame of the stitched video using a machine learning API.

### 3. Multithreading
- Implement the video stitching and frame transformation tasks using multithreading (goroutines) to optimize performance. Each video file should be processed concurrently, and the transformed frames should be combined to create the final video.

### 4. Video Output
- Save the transformed, stitched video to a file named `output_video.mp4`.

## Requirements
- **Input:** Four video files (`video1.mp4`, `video2.mp4`, `video3.mp4`, `video4.mp4`).
- **Output:** A single video file named `output_video.mp4` containing the stitched and transformed frames.

## Technical Specifications
- **Language:** Use Golang (preferred), or any language.
- **Libraries:** You may use any suitable prebuilt libraries for video processing (e.g., `gocv`) and machine learning transformations.
- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for file operations and API calls.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear instructions on how to run your program and any dependencies required.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Correctness:** The program should correctly stitch the videos, apply transformations, and produce the final output video.
- **Multithreading Implementation:** The effectiveness of the multithreading implementation will be evaluated based on performance and code structure.
- **Code Quality:** Clarity, organization, and documentation of the code will be assessed.

## Bonus Points
- Implement additional optimizations or features, such as:
  - Dynamic adjustment of the number of concurrent threads based on system resources.
  - Ability to handle videos with different resolutions and frame rates.
  - Implement a custom machine learning model for more advanced transformations.

## Example Application
As an example, you could develop a video surveillance system that stitches feeds from multiple cameras, applies object detection to identify moving objects, and saves the processed video with bounding boxes around the detected objects. The system should utilize multithreading to efficiently process multiple video streams concurrently.
