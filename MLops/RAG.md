# Implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

## Objective
Build a system that combines large language models (LLMs) with external data sources to improve the quality of generated responses. This project aims to enhance the accuracy and contextual relevance of information provided by LLMs.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Vector Database Integration:** Integrate a vector database (e.g., Pinecone) to store and retrieve relevant documents.
- **LLM Response Generation:** Use an LLM (such as Llama, GPT, etc.) to generate responses based on retrieved documents.
- **Effectiveness Evaluation:** Evaluate the system's effectiveness in providing accurate and contextually relevant information.

## Resources and Tools

### 1. Vector Database
- **Pinecone:** A fully managed vector database that allows you to store and retrieve embeddings efficiently. It supports metadata filtering and is ideal for RAG systems.
- **Weaviate:** An open-source vector database that integrates well with LLMs and supports semantic search.

### 2. Embedding Models
- **OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002:** A powerful embedding model for generating vector representations of text.
- **Sentence Transformers (SBERT):** Useful for generating embeddings that capture semantic similarity.

### 3. RAG Frameworks
- **LlamaIndex:** A library designed to simplify the implementation of RAG systems, providing classes and methods for ingesting documents, embedding them, and querying.
- **LangChain:** A framework that provides tools for building applications with LLMs, including RAG capabilities.

### 4. Document Processing Tools
- **EasyOCR or Tesseract:** For extracting text from images or PDFs, especially useful if your data sources include scanned documents or images with text.
