# Identifying Personal Information in Documents

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create an application that can detect the presence of personal information in documents and data. This personal information could include:

- Names
- Addresses
- Phone numbers
- Social security numbers
- Dates of birth
- Credit card numbers

The application should be able to identify if this type of sensitive personal data is present in a document, even if it is hidden or embedded in the text. This functionality will help organizations ensure they are properly protecting people's private information.

## Key Features
- **Document Scanning:** Scans documents and data for common types of personal information.
- **Advanced Detection:** Detects personal data even if it is not obvious or in a standard format.
- **Reporting:** Provides clear reporting on what sensitive information was found and where it was located.
- **Document Compatibility:** Works with a variety of document types (PDFs, spreadsheets, text files, etc.).
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for running scans and viewing results.
